# ðŸŒŠ Wave-Graph Grammar-Core Concept

## Key Insight
By fixing grammar as the immutable foundation, everything else (vocabulary, emotion, multimodal, behaviors) becomes automated recursion. The system never restarts training â€” it evolves forever.

## Components
1. **Grammar Core**: Universal syntactic + morphological laws.
2. **Automated Vocabulary Expansion**: Continuous domain growth.
3. **Emotion-Behavior Layer**: Built-in human alignment.
4. **Reciprocal Feedback Loops**: Self-evolution with human response.
5. **Multimodal Alphabets**: Text â†” image â†” audio â†” code.
6. **Benchmark Validation**: Efficiency and performance proof.
7. **Self-Evolving Agent**: Emergent socio-emotional intelligence.
